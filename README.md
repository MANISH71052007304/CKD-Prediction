**CKD Prediction Using AI**

**Overview**
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a significant public health problem worldwide. Early prediction and diagnosis are crucial for effective management and treatment. This project aims to leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to predict CKD using medical data. The project is divided into two phases, each employing different machine learning algorithms.

**Phase 2: ANN with Normalization**
In the second phase, we use an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with normalization techniques to enhance prediction accuracy. Normalization helps in scaling the data to a specific range, which can improve the model's performance.

**Normalization Techniques:**

Min-Max Scaling
Z-score Normalization
Model Architecture:
